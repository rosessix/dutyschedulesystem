# Duty Schedule System

### What does it do?
This is a system built to help ease the struggle of making schedules for work. You enter the names of your employees, choose their prefered work days, choose their time off (if they have requested any) and press generate. As simple as that.

You can choose how many shifts can get per month, and their prio in workload. They can be low prio, giving them less shifts than those with "normal" or "high" workload.

### What is it built with?
This project is build with Vite + React. I used ShadCN to make the UI a little easier to make, as I made this project rather quickly to show my own colleague how I can help ease his burden with schedule making.
